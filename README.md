# Microsoft Learn module exercises using Terraform

I created this repo as I go through various Azure-related Microosft Learn modules and use terraform to complete the exercises/labs within the sandbox environments.

The goal of this is to practicing building simple terraform templates (in lieu of using Azure Portal, CLI or PowerShell) and gain exposure to the various resource types with their respective requirements, considerations, quirks.

Especially with the time limits imposed on the Azure Learn sandbox environments, most of these are going to be built "quick and dirty" and won't always follow best practices or use more neat and organized (complex) structures, such as modules. However, it is a good chance to experiment with different ways of using loops and such (maybe eventually conditionals, etc.)
